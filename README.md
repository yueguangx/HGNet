# HGNet
目标检测项目
This project is based on the paper "HGNet: High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale Context Attention Network for Colorectal Polyp Detection". It implements and optimizes the proposed HGNet model for colorectal polyp detection, leveraging high-order spatial awareness and multi-scale context attention mechanisms. The goal is to improve detection accuracy and efficiency in medical image analysis.
